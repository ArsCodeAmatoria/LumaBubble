# Placeholder WASM File
# In a real implementation, this would be a compiled Haskell physics simulation
# that handles the complex sonoluminescence bubble dynamics.

# The Haskell simulation would include:
# - Rayleigh-Plesset equation solver
# - Thermal dynamics
# - Pressure wave modeling  
# - Light emission calculations
# - Real-time parameter updates

# For now, the JavaScript simulation in the simulator page provides
# a simplified version of the physics for demonstration purposes.
